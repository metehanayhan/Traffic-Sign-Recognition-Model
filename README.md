# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Model
 This project is a deep learning application designed to recognize German traffic signs. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system classifies traffic sign images into 43 different categories. The project includes a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit, allowing users to upload traffic sign images and get real-time predictions.
